# ROADMAP:

### TODO:

- [x] Completelly refactored AUTOMATED MIGRATION MODE to allow parallel Threads for Downloads and Uploads and avoid to download All assets before to upload them (this will safe disk space and improve performance). Also objects support has been added to this mode for an easier implementation of this mode.
- [x] Code Refactored to convert ServiceGooglePhotos, ServiceSynologyPhotos and ServiceImmichPhotos into Classes (ClassTakeoutFolder, ClassSynologyPhotos, ClassImmichPhotos) and homogenized all functions of all these classes.
- [x] Added new Class ClassLocalFolder with the same methods as Cloud Services Classes to manage Local Folders in the same way as a Photo Cloud Service.
