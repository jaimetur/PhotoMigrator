# Execution from Compiled Binaries: \(easiest way)

### 📥 1. Copy and unzip the downloaded compiled tool into any local folder or to any Shared folder of your server or Synology NAS.

### 📝 2. Edit the configuration file:

Open the file `Config.ini` included in the package with any text editor and update it with your credentials and settings.

> For more information, refer to [Configuration File](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/help/0-configuration-file.md) .

### 🚀 3. Execute the Tool depending on your environment:
  - If you run it from Windows (using Shell or PowerShell terminal) you have to call the master script '**PhotoMigrator.exe**'  

  - If you run it from Synology NAS (using SSH terminal) or from Linux/Mac, you have to call the master script '**PhotoMigrator.run**'.  
    Minimum version required to run the Tool directly from your Synology NAS (using SSH terminal) is **DSM 7.0**.
