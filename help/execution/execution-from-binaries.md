# Instructions to execute from Compiled Binaries: \(easier way)

### 1. You can copy and unzip the downloaded compiled tool into any local folder or to any Shared folder of your server or Synology NAS.

### 2. Edit the configuration file:

Open `Config.ini` in any text editor and update it with your credentials and settings.

> For more information, refer to [Configuration File](/help/0-configuration-file.md) .

### 3 Execute the Tool depending on your environment:
  - If you run it from Windows (using Shell or PowerShell terminal) you have to call the master script '**CloudPhotoMigrator.exe**'  

  - If you run it from Synology NAS (using SSH terminal) or from Linux/Mac, you have to call the master script '**CloudPhotoMigrator.run**'.  
    Minimum version required to run the Tool directly from your Synology NAS (using SSH terminal) is **DSM 7.0**.
