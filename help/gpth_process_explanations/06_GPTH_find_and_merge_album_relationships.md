# Step 6: Find and merge album relationships

This sophisticated step analyzes the media collection to identify files that represent the same photo/video across different albums and locations, then merges them into unified Media objects. This is crucial for Google Photos exports where the same file appears in both year folders and multiple album folders.

## Album Relationship Detection

### Content-Based Matching
- **Hash Comparison**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to identify identical file content
- **Size Verification**: Pre-filters by file size before expensive hash calculations
- **Binary Comparison**: Ensures exact content matches for reliable identification
- **Performance Optimization**: Groups by size first to minimize hash operations

### File Location Analysis
- **Year Folder Files**: Primary files from "Photos from YYYY" directories
- **Album Folder Files**: Duplicate copies in named album directories
- **Cross-Reference Mapping**: Identifies which albums contain each photo
- **Relationship Preservation**: Maintains all album associations for each file

### Multi-Album Detection
Files appearing in multiple albums are properly handled:
- **Album List Consolidation**: Merges all album names into single Media object
- **File Path Preservation**: Keeps references to all file locations
- **Metadata Reconciliation**: Chooses best metadata from available sources
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Removes redundant Media objects after merging

## Merging Logic

### Data Consolidation Strategy
When multiple Media objects represent the same file:
1. **Date Accuracy Priority**: Chooses the Media with best date accuracy
2. **Album Information Merge**: Combines all album associations
3. **File Reference Consolidation**: Preserves all file location references
4. **Metadata Selection**: Uses most reliable metadata source
5. **Original Cleanup**: Removes now-redundant Media objects

### Best Source Selection
The algorithm prioritizes:
- **Higher date accuracy** (lower accuracy number = better)
- **Shorter filename length** (often indicates original vs processed)
- **Year folder over album folder** (primary source preference)
- **Earlier discovery order** (first found = canonical)

### Album Association Management
- **Null Key Preservation**: Maintains year folder association (null key)
- **Named Album Keys**: Preserves all album folder associations
- **Album Name Cleanup**: Handles special characters and emoji in album names
- **Hierarchy Respect**: Maintains Google Photos album organization structure

## Processing Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- **Size-Based Grouping**: Groups files by size before hash comparison
- **Incremental Processing**: Processes files in batches for memory efficiency
- **Hash Caching**: Avoids recalculating hashes for the same files
- **Early Termination**: Skips further processing when no matches possible

### Scalability Features
- **Large Collection Support**: Efficiently handles thousands of photos
- **Memory Management**: Processes groups incrementally to control memory usage
- **Progress Reporting**: Provides feedback for long-running operations
- **Interruption Handling**: Can be safely interrupted and resumed

## Album Behavior Preparation

This step prepares the media collection for various album handling modes:

### Shortcut Mode Preparation
- **Primary File Identification**: Designates main file for each photo
- **Album Reference Setup**: Prepares album folder references for linking
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Ensures clean album/primary relationships

### Duplicate-Copy Mode Preparation
- **Multi-Location Tracking**: Maintains all file location information
- **Copy Source Identification**: Identifies which files to copy where
- **Album Structure Mapping**: Maps album organization for replication

### JSON Mode Preparation
- **Album Membership Tracking**: Records which albums contain each file
- **Metadata Consolidation**: Prepares album information for JSON export
- **File-Album Associations**: Creates mapping for JSON output generation

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### File Access Issues
- **Permission Errors**: Gracefully handles inaccessible files
- **Corrupted Files**: Skips files that cannot be hashed
- **Missing Files**: Handles broken file references
- **Network Storage**: Manages timeouts and connection issues

### Data Integrity Protection
- **Hash Verification**: Ensures content matching is accurate
- **Metadata Validation**: Verifies merged metadata consistency
- **Rollback Capability**: Can undo merging if issues detected
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks all merge operations for debugging

### Special Cases
- **Identical Filenames**: Handles files with same name but different content
- **Modified Timestamps**: Manages files with different modification times
- **Size Variations**: Handles minor size differences due to metadata changes
- **Encoding Differences**: Manages files with different character encodings

## Integration and Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- **Media Discovery**: Requires fully populated MediaCollection
- **Date Extraction**: Benefits from date information for conflict resolution
- **Duplicate Removal**: Should run after basic duplicate detection

### Output Usage
- **File Moving**: Provides unified Media objects for organization
- **Album Creation**: Enables proper album folder structure generation
- **Symlink Creation**: Supports linking strategies for album modes
- **Statistics Generation**: Provides data for final processing reports

### Configuration Dependencies
- **Album Behavior**: Different merging strategies for different output modes
- **Verbose Mode**: Controls detailed progress and statistics reporting
- **Performance Settings**: May use different algorithms for large collections
