# Instructions to execute from Docker Container: \(recommended)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> ### âœ… Prerequisites:
> - Install Docker in your system (if it is not installed yet) and run it.  You can find instructions of how to install Docker in the following links:  
>     - [Install Docker on Windows](/help/install-docker-windows.md)  
>     - [Install Docker on Linux](/help/install-docker-linux.md)  
>     - [Install Docker on MacOS](/help/install-docker-macos.md)  


Once you have Docker installed and running on your system, you have twoo options to run the Tool from a Docker Container Image:
## 1. Run Docker Container directly:

- For Linux / MacOS: 
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/docker jaimetur/cloudphotomigrator:latest [options]
  ```
- For Windows (PowerShell): 
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v "${PWD}:/docker" jaimetur/cloudphotomigrator:latest [options]
  ```
- For Windows (Command Prompt): 
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v "%cd%":/docker jaimetur/cloudphotomigrator:latest [options]
  ```

Where [options] are the arguments that you want to pass to the Tool (i.e: -h)

Example for Linux / MacOS:
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/docker jaimetur/cloudphotomigrator:latest --source=./MyTakeout --target=immich
  ```

## 2. Run Docker from a Pre-built Shell Script (recommended):

This is the recommended option, since it will download a small package that contains:
- A shell script to run the docker container in a easier way
- Default Configuration file (Config.ini)
- Documentation folder
- Help follder
- docker.conf file to easilly select the docker container image that you want to run

If you chose this option, just need to follow the next steps:

### 1. Download the ZIP package:

Download the latest version of the Docker package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jaimetur/CloudPhotoMigrator/releases), or use this command:

- **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    curl -L -o CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip https://github.com/jaimetur/CloudPhotoMigrator/releases/download/v3.1.0-beta1/CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip
    ```
  
- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    curl.exe -L -o CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip https://github.com/jaimetur/CloudPhotoMigrator/releases/download/v3.1.0-beta1/CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip
    ```

### 2. Unzip the downloaded package:

- **Linux/macOS:**
    ```bash
    unzip CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip -d CloudPhotoMigrator
    cd CloudPhotoMigrator
    ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    powershell -Command "Expand-Archive -Path CloudPhotoMigrator_v3.1.0-beta1_docker.zip -DestinationPath CloudPhotoMigrator"
    cd CloudPhotoMigrator
    ```

### 3. Edit the docker.conf file (optional):   

If you want to pull a different release image (default: latest) you can change the .env file  

```
# Set the RELEASE_TAG for the image that you want to pull
RELEASE_TAG=latest
```


### 4. Edit the configuration file:

Open `Config.ini` in any text editor and update it with your credentials and settings.

> For more information, refer to [Configuration File](/help/0-configuration-file.md) .


### 5. Run the Tool to show the command line help:

Make sure Docker is running, then:

- **Linux / MacOS:**
    ```bash
    ./CloudPhotoMigrator.sh -h

    ```
  or, if your system requires elevation to execute docker:
    ```bash
    sudo ./CloudPhotoMigrator.sh -h
    ```

- **Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    CloudPhotoMigrator.bat -h
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> - The required Docker image is pulled the first time you run the script or if the remote image has changed.
> - If `Config.ini` is missing, the tool will automatically create a default one and ask you to edit it before continuing.
