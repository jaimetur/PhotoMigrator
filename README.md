Or check the [Historical Releases Notes](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/docs/RELEASES-NOTES.md) to choose any specific release. 

> [!NOTE]  
> The Tool is Multi-Platform and Multi-Architecture, and has been designed to be run directly within a Linux Server or NAS such as Synology NAS (Compatible with DSM 7.0 or higher), so feel free to download the version according to your system. 
> 
> You can also execute the Tool from a Docker container or from sources files for a better compatibility. In below sections you can find the execution instructions to run the Tool from the different methods.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File:
In order to connect to the different Photo Cloud Services, you must configure the conection settings using the Configuration file (Config.ini) provided with the Tool.  

You can see how to configure the Configuration File in this help section:
[Configuration File](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/help/0-configuration-file.md) 


## ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface:
This Tool is based on commands given through the Command Line Interface (CLI), so it is important to know the syntax of that interface.  

You can check the whole list of features and arguments with the right syntax here:

## üöÄ Automatic Migration Feature (Main Use Case):

> [!NOTE]  
>## <span style="color:green">üöÄ Automatic Migration Feature</span>
>From version 3.0.0 onwards, the Tool supports a new Feature called '**Automatic Migration**'. 
>
> Use the argument **'--source'** to select the \<SOURCE> client and the argument **'--target'** to select \<TARGET> client for the Automatic Migration Process to Pull all your Assets (including Albums) from the \<SOURCE> Cloud Service and Push them to the \<TARGET> Cloud Service (including all Albums that you may have on the <SOURCE> Cloud Service).
> 
>  - Possible values for:
>    - **\<SOURCE\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos']-[id] or <INPUT_FOLDER>  (id=[1, 2, 3] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    - **\<TARGET\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos']-[id] or <OUTPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2, 3] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    
> 
>  - The idea is complete above list to allow also Google Photos and Apple Photos (iCloud), so when this is done, the allowed values will be:
>    - **\<SOURCE\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos', 'google-photos', 'apple-photos']-[id]  or <INPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2, 3] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    - **\<TARGET\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos', 'google-photos', 'apple-photos']-[id]  or <OUTPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2, 3] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>
> If you ommit the suffix -[id], the tool will assume that account 1 will be used for the specified client (ie: --source=synology-photos means that Synology Photos account 1 will be used as \<SOURCE> client.)  
>
> Also, you can ommit the suffix -photos in both \<SOURCE> and \<TARGET> clients, so, you can just use --source=synology --target=immich to set Synology Photos account 1 as \<SOURCE> client and Immich Photos account 1 as \<TARGET> client.  
> 
> It is also possible to specify the account-id using the argument _**'-id, --account-id \<ID>'**_ (ie: --source=synology --account-id=2 means that Synology Photos account 2 will be used as \<SOURCE> client.)  
> 
>> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**:  
>> Take into account that the argument _**'-id, --account-id \<ID>'**_ applies for all the Photo Cloud Services (Synology Photos and Immich Photos, so if you specify the client ID using this argument, and you have more than one Photo Cloud Service, all of them will use the same client ID.)
> 
> By default, the whole Migration process is executed in parallel using multi-threads (it will detect automatically the number of threads of the CPU to set properly the number of Push workers). The Pull worker and the different Push workes will be executed in parallel using an assets queue to guarantee that no more than 100 assets will be temporarily stored on your local drive, so you don't need to care about the hard disk space needed during this migration process.  
> 
> By default, (if your terminal size has enough width and heigh) a Live Dashboard will show you all the details about the migration process, including most relevant log messages, and counter status. You can disable this Live Dashboard using the argument **'-dashboard=false or --dashboard=false'**.   
> 
> Additionally, this Automatic Migration process can also be executed sequentially instead of in parallel, using argument **--parallel=false**, so first, all the assets will be pulled from <SOURCE> and when finish, they will be pushed into <TARGET>, but take into account that in this case, you will need enough disk space to store all your assets pulled from <SOURCE> service.
>
> Finally, you can apply filters to filter assets to pull from \<SOURCE> client. The available filters are: 
>    - **by Type:**
>      - argument: -type, --filter-by-type
>        - Valid values are [image, video, all]
>    - **by Dates:**
>      - arguments:
>        - -from, --filter-from-date
>        - -to, --filter-to-date
>      - Valid values are in one of those formats: 
>        - dd/mm/yyyy
>        - dd-mm-yyyy
>        - yyyy/mm/dd
>        - yyyy-mm-dd
>        - mm/yyyy
>        - mm-yyyy
>        - yyyy/mm
>        - yyyy-mm
>        - yyyy 
>    - **by Country:**
>      - argument: -country, --filter-by-country
>        - Valid values are any existing country in the \<SOURCE> client.
>    - **by City:**
>      - argument: -city, --filter-by-city
>        - Valid values are any existing city in the \<SOURCE> client.
>    - **by Person:**
>      - argument: -person, --filter-by-person
>        - Valid values are any existing person in the \<SOURCE> client.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you use a local folder <INPUT_FOLDER> as source client, all your Albums should be placed into a subfolder called *'Albums'* within <INPUT_FOLDER>, creating one Album subfolder per Album, otherwise the tool will no create any Album in the target client.  
>
> Example:  
> <INPUT_FOLDER>/Album1  
> <INPUT_FOLDER>/Album2  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is important that you configure properly the file 'Config.ini' (included with the tool), to set properly the accounts for your Photo Cloud Service.
