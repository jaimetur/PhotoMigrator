# **CloudPhotoMigrator**
This tool has been designed to Interact and Manage different Photos Cloud services, and allow users to do an <span style="color:green">**Automated Migration** </span> from one Photo Cloud service to other or from one account to a new account of the same Photo Cloud service.  

As of today, the Supported Photo Cloud Services are:
- **Google Photos Takeout**
  - Unpack your Takeout Zip files.
  - Process .json files to fix metadata (including creation date and time) of all your assets.
  - Merge Live picture with separate files (.HEIC and .MP4).
  - Separate your assets per Albums (if belong to any album).
  - Organize your assets in a year/month structure for a better organization.
  - Create Symbolic Links for assets within any Album (to save disk space).
  - Detect and remove duplicates.

- **Synology Photos** - Features included:
  - Upload Album(s)
  - Upload ALL (from folder)
  - Download Album(s)
  - Download ALL (into folder)
  - Remove ALL Assets
  - Remove ALL Albums
  - Remove Empty Albums
  - Remove Duplicates Albums

- **Immich Photos** - Features included:
  - Upload Album(s)
  - Upload ALL (from folder)
  - Download Album(s)
  - Download ALL (into folder)
  - Remove ALL Assets
  - Remove ALL Albums
  - Remove Empty Albums
  - Remove Duplicates Albums
  - Remove Orphans Assets

- **Apple Photos**  
  (not available yet but is on the [ROADMAP.md](/docs/ROADMAP.md) for next release)

- **Google Photos**  
  (not available yet but is on the [ROADMAP.md](/docs/ROADMAP.md) for next release)


Apart from Manage the different Photo Cloud Services, the Tool also contains some other useful features such as:
- **Metadata fixing** of any Photo Library in your local drive (not necesarely needs to be a Google Takeout folder)
- **Library Organization** features:
  - Manage Duplicates assets
  - Splitting of assets with and without associated albums
  - Folder Structure (customizable) for 'Albums' and 'No Albums' folders
- **Symbolic Links Support** for Albums folders
  - Fix Symbolic Links Broken
- **Homogenize Albums folders name based on content**
- **Remove Empty Albums in Photo Cloud Services** 
- **Remove Duplicates Albums in Photo Cloud Services**

## Main Use Case: Automated Migration Feature
> [!NOTE]  
>## <span style="color:green">Automated Migration Feature</span>
>From version 3.0.0 onwards, the Tool supports a new Feature called '**Automated Migration**'. 
>
> Use the argument **'--source'** to select the \<SOURCE> and the argument **'--target'** to select \<TARGET> for the Automated Migration Process to Pull all your Assets (including Albums) from the \<SOURCE> Cloud Service and Push them to the \<TARGET> Cloud Service (including all Albums that you may have on the <SOURCE> Cloud Service).
> 
>  - Possible values for:
>    - **\<SOURCE\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos']-[id] or <INPUT_FOLDER>  (id=[1, 2] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    - **\<TARGET\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos']-[id] or <OUTPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    
> 
>  - The idea is complete above list to allow also Google Photos and Apple Photos (iCloud), so when this is done, the allowed values will be:
>    - **\<SOURCE\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos', 'google-photos', 'apple-photos']-[id]  or <INPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>    - **\<TARGET\>** : ['synology-photos', 'immich-photos', 'google-photos', 'apple-photos']-[id]  or <OUTPUT_FOLDER> (id=[1, 2] to select which account to use from the Config.ini file).  
>
> If you ommit the suffix -[id], the tool will assume that account 1 will be used for the specified client (ie: --source=synology-photos means that Synology Photos account 1 will be used as \<SOURCE> client.)  
> 
> Also, you can ommit the suffix -photos in both \<SOURCE> and \<TARGET> clients, so, you can just use --source=synology --target=immich to set Synology Photos account 1 as \<SOURCE> client and Immich Photos account 1 as \<TARGET> client.  
> 
> By default, the whole Migration process is executed in parallel using multi-threads (it will detect automatically the number of threads of the CPU to set properly the number of Push workers.  
> The Pull worker and the different Push workes will be executed in parallel using an assets queue to guarantee that no more than 100 assets will be temporarily stored on your local drive, so you don't need to care about the hard disk space needed during this migration process.  
> 
> By default, (if your terminal size has enough width and heigh) a Live Dashboard will show you all the details about the migration process, including most relevant log messages, and counter status. You can disable this Live Dashboard using the flag **'-dashboard=false or --dashboard=false'**.   
> 
> Additionally, this Automated Migration process can also be executed secuencially instead of in parallel, so first, all the assets will be pulled from <SOURCE> and when finish, they will be pushed into <TARGET>, but take into account that in this case, you will need enough disk space to store all your assets pulled from <SOURCE> service.
> 
> Also, take into account that in this case, the Live Dashboard will not be displayed, so you only will see the different messages log in the screen, but not the live counters during the migration.  
> and execute this feature, the Tool will automatically do the whole migration job from \<SOURCE> Cloud Service to \<TARGET> Cloud Service.  

> [!WARNING]  
> If you use a local folder <INPUT_FOLDER> as source client, all your Albums should be placed into a subfolder called *'Albums'* within <INPUT_FOLDER>, creating one Album subfolder per Album, otherwise the tool will no create any Album in the target client.  
>
> Example:  
> <INPUT_FOLDER>/Album1  
> <INPUT_FOLDER>/Album2  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is important that you configure properly the file 'Config.ini' (included with the tool), to set properly the accounts for your Photo Cloud Services.
