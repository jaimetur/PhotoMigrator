# üì∏ **PhotoMigrator**
This tool has been designed to Interact and Manage different Photos Cloud services, and allow users to do an <span style="color:green">**Automatic Migration**</span> from one Photo Cloud service to other or from one account to a new account of the same Photo Cloud service. 


## üñ•Ô∏è Live Dashboard Preview
![Live Dashboard](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/assets/screenshots/live_dashboard.jpg?raw=true)  

## üåü Main Modules Included:
## üöÄ 1. Automatic Migration   
The main use case is the **Automatic Migration Feature** to migrate all your photos and videos from one Photo cloud service to other, or between different accounts of the same service.  

[**(Automatic Migration Documentation)**](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/help/3-automatic-migration.md)


## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Google Takeout Fixing 
Other important feature included in the tool is the Google Takeout Fixing. 

This feature has been designed to automatically analyze your Google Photos Takeout, extract all the information from the sidecar JSON files (or guess some missing information using heuristics algorithms) and embeds all the extracted info into each asset file using EXIF tags.  

In this way your Media Library will be ready to be migrated to any other Cloud Photo services without losing any important info such as, Albums info, Original date, GPS location, Camera info, etc...

But this feature also helps you to organize and clean your Media Library removing duplicates, creating Year/Month folder structure, creating symbolic links for Albums assets, Auto renaming Albums to clean their names and include a prefix with the date of its assets, etc...

The whole process is done in an automatic way and is divided in different steps (some of them are optionals).

Below you can see the different steps of this feature:

#### 1. Pre Checks steps
  - Unpack your Takeout Zip files if needed. 
  - Create a backup of your original Takeout if needed. 
  - Calculate statistics of your original Takeout. 
#### 2. Pre Process steps
  - Merge Live picture with separate files (.HEIC and .MP4).
  - Fix  Truncations on sidecar JSON names and media files to complete truncated suffixes or extensions when the filename length is high. 
#### 3. Process steps
  - Process .json files to fix metadata (including creation date and time, GPS data, Albums info extraction, etc...) of all your assets.
  - Separate your assets per Albums (if belong to any album).
  - Create Symbolic Links for assets within any Album (to save disk space).
#### 4. Post Process steps
  - Synchronize MP4 files associated to Live pictures with the associated HEIC/JPG file. 
  - Organize your assets in a year/month structure for a better organization.
  - Separate all your Albums folders within 'Albums' subfolder from the original assets within 'ALL_PHOTOS' subfolder. 
  - Fix broken Symbolic Links. 
  - Detect and remove duplicates.
  - Auto rename Albums folders to homogenize all names based on content dates. 
  - Remove empty folders. 
  - Clean Final Media Library. 
  - Calculate statistics of your Final processed Media Library and compare it with your original Takeout statistics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration File
In order to connect to the different Photo Cloud Services, you must configure the connection settings using the Configuration file `Config.ini` provided with the Tool.  

You can see how to configure the Configuration File in this help section:
[Configuration File](https://github.com/jaimetur/PhotoMigrator/blob/main/help/0-configuration-file.md) 


## ‚å®Ô∏è Command Line Interface
This Tool is based on commands given through the Command Line Interface (CLI), so it is important to know the syntax of that interface.
