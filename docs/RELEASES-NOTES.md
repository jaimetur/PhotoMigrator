        '-da, --duplicates-action' to specify the action to do with the duplicates files found.

  With this example, the Tool will find duplicates files within folders ./Albums and ./ALL_PHOTOS,
  If finds any duplicated, will keep the file within ./Albums folder (bacause it has been passed first on the list)
  and will move the otherss duplicates files into the ./Duplicates folder on the root folder of the Tool.
